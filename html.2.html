        <h3>KINDERGARTEN TO 3RD GRADE</h3>
        <p>I started out in Learning Tree Montessori School. This place holds such great memories from learning phonetics to doing activities on a daily basis. It set a great platform for my learning as I had learnt a lot of communication and people skills rather than focusing on set curriculums. This school built a foundation on phonetics and life skills since LKG and UKG, they taught us to clean up after ourselves and what not.</p>

        <a href="https://learningtreechennai.com/" style="color:blue;">This is the school's official website.</a>
        <p>My best memories from learning tree were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break periods where we would have running races and play interesting games</li>
            <li>School plays: The preparation was just too fun and at the same time I got a lot of lead roles....OFC</li>
            <li>Show and tell every morning</li>
            <li>School trip day: Amazing day where we go to a random place that no one really cared about but did get partnered with girls so that was fun. Besides that later on we would have an overnight stay in the school premise that brought along the best of memories and times</li>
            <li>Might have had a girlfriend in UKG</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3RD GRADE TO 5TH GRADE</h3>
        <p>Now for a new chapter I had gone to Vaels International School. This has to be the coolest school but the amount of spoilt rich kids are literally infinite. The standard of studies was not as good as I thought, adding to that the school was around 25-30 kms from where I lived so it wasn't ideal to be.</p>
        <p>The upside was that I was able to make a lot of friends and at the same time sports was very much encouraged in the school. We had tournaments, special programs and other fun activities. 3 out of 5 days we had SPA (SPORTS AND PERFORMING ARTS) being either karate, dance, yoga or theatre. Plus the school had air conditioning which was extremely cold, so even in peak summers we used to carry jackets to school.</p>
