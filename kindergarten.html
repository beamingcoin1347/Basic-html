        <h3>KINDERGARTEN TO 3RD GRADE</h3>
        <p>I started out in Learning Tree Montessori School. This place holds such great memories from learning phonetics to doing activities on a daily basis. It set a great platform for my learning as I had learnt a lot of communication and people skills rather than focusing on set curriculums. This school built a foundation on phonetics and life skills since LKG and UKG, they taught us to clean up after ourselves and what not.</p>

        <a href="https://learningtreechennai.com/" style="color: #ffffff;">This is the school's official website.</a>
        <p>My best memories from learning tree were:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Break periods where we would have running races and play interesting games</li>
            <li>School plays: The preparation was just too fun and at the same time I got a lot of lead roles....OFC</li>
            <li>Show and tell every morning</li>
            <li>School trip day: Amazing day where we go to a random place that no one really cared about but did get partnered with girls so that was fun. Besides that later on we would have an overnight stay in the school premise that brought along the best of memories and times</li>
            <li>Might have had a girlfriend in UKG</li>
        </ul>
